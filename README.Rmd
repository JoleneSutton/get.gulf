R functions to retrieve raw data from package `gulf` (*e.g.,* [here](https://github.com/dfo-gulf-science/gulf/tree/master), [here](https://github.com/ricardd/gulf2), and [here](https://github.com/TobieSurette/gulf.data)), and perform downstream processing and quality control prior to analysis.

# Capacity

## Research Vessel (RV)
The current capacity is for sGSL September Research Vessel survey data collected from years 2004-2024, using two different vessels:

  + the CCGS Teleost (2004 - 2022) fishing a Western IIA bottom-trawl
  + the CCGS Capt. Jacques Cartier (2021 - 2024), fishing a modified version of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center Ecosystem Survey Trawl, NEST (trawl details in [Denton 2020](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/4087638x.pdf); modifications outlined in [Ricard et al. 2023](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2023/mpo-dfo/Fs97-6-3547-eng.pdf)).

Vessel conversion factors are from [Beno√Æt and Yin, 2023](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/41220614.pdf). link to object of rhos

Diel conversion factors are from source... Alfred Needler, as recommended by source, see (table of diel cfs)

Tow distance corrections specific to each vessel (e.g., 1.74 nm for Teleost, and 1.0 nm for Cartier)

Sampling ratios adjusted to 1.0

Length-weight calculations were done for years x-y, point to code and table of results
